# Chapter 4: Properties of Regular Languages
## 4.1 | Closure Properties of Regular Languages
Consider the following question: Given two regular languages _L1_ and _L2_, is
their union also regular? ? It turns out that the answer is yes, a fact we express by saying
that the family of regular languages is **closed** under union. 

### Closure Under Simple Set Operations
If _L<sub>1</sub>_ and _L<sub>2</sub>_ are regular languages, then so are _L<sub>1</sub> ∪ L<sub>2</sub> , L<sub>1</sub> ∩ L<sub>2</sub> , L<sub>1</sub>L<sub>2</sub> , L<sub>1</sub>', and L∗_. We say that the family of regular languages is closed under union,
intersection, concatenation, complementation, and star-closure.
