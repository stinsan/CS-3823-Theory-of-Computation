**Automaton**: Abstract, mathematical computing device

>Input	→ Transducer → Output <br/>
Input	→ Acceptor (also called recognizer) → Yes or no (can only solve "decision" problems)

**Language**: any set of objects (strings)

**Formal language**: a language defined by an automaton or any other "finite system"

**Finite system**: a rule-based, mathematical system with finitely many rules

**Grammar**: syntatic rules defining a language

Note: Solving a problem = recognizing a language

**Proof by mathematical induction**:
  1. Induction basis: prove P(1)
  2. Induction hypothesis: assume P(k) such that k >= 1
  3. Induction step: prove P(k+1)

> Example: Given sets A and B, prove that A = B. <br/>
  Prove that A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A.

**Contrapositive proof**: To prove that A ⇒ B, prove that ¬A ⇒ ¬B

**Counterexample**: To prove "∀ x P(x)" is not true, it is sufficient to present a case of x such that P(x) is false.

**Relation**: a set of ordered pairs of objects of a set S

A relation R on a set S is:
  1. reflexive if aRa ∀ a ∈ S.
  2. symmetric if aRb ⇒ bRa ∀ a, b ∈ S.
  3. transitive if aRb and bRc ⇒ aRc ∀ a, b, c ∈ S.
  
A relation which is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive is called an equivalence relation.
