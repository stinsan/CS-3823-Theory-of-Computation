**Automaton** - Abstract, mathematical computing device

>Input	→ Transducer → Output <br/>
Input	→ Acceptor (also called recognizer) → Yes or no (can only solve "decision" problems)

**Language** - any set of objects (strings)

**Formal language** - a language defined by an automaton or any other "finite system"

**Finite system** - a rule-based, mathematical system with finitely many rules

**Grammar** - syntatic rules defining a language

- Solving a problem = recognizing a language

**Proof by mathematical induction**:
  1. Induction basis: prove P(1)
  2. Induction hypothesis: assume P(k) such that k >= 1
  3. Induction step: prove P(k+1)

> Example: Given sets A and B, prove that A = B. <br/>
  Prove that A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A.

**Contrapositive proof**: To prove that A ⇒ B, prove that ¬A ⇒ ¬B

**Counterexample**: To prove "∀ x P(x)" is not true, it is sufficient to present a case of x such that P(x) is false.
