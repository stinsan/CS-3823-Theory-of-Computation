**Automaton** - Abstract, mathematical computing device

>Input	→ Transducer → Output

>Input	→ Acceptor (also called recognizer) → Yes or no (can only solve "decision" problems)

**Language** - any set of objects (strings)

**Formal language** - a language defined by an automaton or any other "finite system"

**Finite system** - a rule-based, mathematical system with finitely many rules

**Grammar** - syntatic rules defining a language

- Solving a problem = recognizing a language

Mathematical induction - to prove for all n that P(n):
  1. Induction basis: prove P(1)
  2. Induction hypothesis: assume P(k) such that k >= 1
  3. Induction step: prove P(k+1)
