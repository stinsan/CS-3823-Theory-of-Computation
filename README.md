# Theory of Computation

These are my notes for the Theory of Computation (CS 3823) course taught by Dr. Changwook Kim
during the Fall 2019 semester at the University of Oklahoma. These notes were taken directly from selected chapters of the textbook, 
_An Introduction to Formal Languages and Automata 6th ed._ by Linz, and paraphrased by me. Some chapters and sections were omitted 
because they were not covered in class.
